### Description:
- This example shows you how to use the **GameKeyData** to control a character. It also shows you how to animate an object with the framework's **animation engine**.
- **GameKeyData**: is a component which allows to control the game thanks to **Virtual Keys on the screen** on Android (you can change the position of the keys, the transparency) and on PC / Web with the **Keys of the Keyboard** (you can configure these keys in **[GameConfig.h](./app/src/main/cpp/app_src/config/GameConfig.h#L51)**).
